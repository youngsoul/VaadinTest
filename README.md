Test Application integrating Grails 2.2.0 and Vaadin 7

This is a simple test application to show the integration of Grails 2.2 with Vaadin 7.

This Grails application relies on a support plugin that I also wrote that can be found at the link below:

https://github.com/youngsoul/VaadinSupportPlugin

The purpose of the application was to simulate a simple login, following by a main view and a seconary view and using the Vaadin support classes that I wrote in the plugin.

When the app first starts up it shows a login screen, admin/admin is the username and password which takes you to the main view with a selection box.  The secondary view has a table of values.

Again, this app was really written as a technology sandbox to understand how to use these technologies together.
